# Snake-game-QBASIC
This is a game designed on my 10th standard using QBASIC. The code is quite simple and easy to understand. It has a good user interface as graphics are used in it. There are 3 levels, each level has its own difficulty levels. At the end you can view your high score and even provide a feedback.
